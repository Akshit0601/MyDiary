# MyDiary
Name:Akshit Shishodia Roll_No:210104015

This is my "myDiary" app

Things I have included:

used navgraph and fragments instead of intents
have changed default app icon
changed default theme (both dark and light)
used color tool for desiging the theme.xml(both dark and light)
used binding instead of calling findViewByid()
Tried to include room database to save entries but could'nt sync gradle files by adding room dependencies into my original gradle files,
but have created a a database scheme(commented) and a mutablelist containing all the text(with line no. as index)
