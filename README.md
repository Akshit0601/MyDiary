# MyDiary

Name:Akshit Shishodia
Roll_No:210104015

This is my "myDiary" app

Things I have included:
1. used navgraph and fragments instead of intents
2. have changed default app icon
3. changed default theme (both dark and light)
4. used color tool for desiging the theme.xml(both dark and light)
5. used binding instead of calling findViewByid()

Not able to print the line object text in TextView after it is uplaoaded/added to the database either there's problem with my Database scheme or some internal error while executing onBindViewHolder in ListAdapter

everything's in master branch
